## Description

- This python application contains three functions fibonacci, lucas and sum_series.

- Fibonacci: This function has the parameter (number). The function will return the nth value in the fibonacci series using recursion.

- Lucas: This function has the parameter n. The function will return the nth value in the lucas series using recursion.

- sum_series: This function has the required parameter(number). There are two optional parameters x and y

  - if x is 0 and y = 1 then it will return the fibonacci number

  - Likewise if x is 2 and y is 1 then it will return the lucas number

- This application also has a series of tests in test_series.py, which test all of the functions with multiple cases.
